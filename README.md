AnimShader
==========

Hello everyone and welcome to the AnimShader lib documentation.
This lib was born because I needed a quick way to managing, saving ,loading and assign shaders
to an animation rig without going crazy with it.

You can find the documentation at this link:
http://giordi91.github.io/ .

Feel free to contact me for any advice or error report etc.( I am sure there are massive amount of typos and English errors).
